# Python Tips

## Knowledge Base
### Hashable Data Types
Usually *immutable* types in Python is also hashable as they will have a `__hash__()` method which
returns a hash value that NEVER changes during their lifetime. See [Python glossary](https://docs.python.org/3.8/glossary.html)

**Hashable types:** `str`, `int`, `float`, `tuple`, and `NoneType`

**Unhashable types:** `dict`, `List`, and `set`


## Technical Tricks
### Swapping
```python
# python built-in method (without temp)
x = 10
y = 20
x, y = y, x
```

### Rotating Array
```python
# Rotating right by k
n = len(arr)
k %= n
arr[:] = arr[n-k:] + arr[:n-k]
```

### Reverse Python String
The easiest and fastest way is through slicing.
```python
s = "reverse me !"
s = s[::-1] # slicing reverse ("smily reverse")
```

### Looping Backward
Note that `range()` function returns an immutable sequence type (i.e. `range` type) that excludes `stop` (similar to slicing).
Example, loop through `range(5)` will give you `0 1 2 3 4` so `stop=-1` is crucial.
```python
s = 'hello'
for i in range(len(s), -1, -1): # range(start, stop, step)
    print(s[i])
```

### Compare Two Unordered Lists
```python
a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
b = [3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
```
`a` and `b` should be considered equal, because they have exactly the same elements, only in different order.
See [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7828867/how-to-efficiently-compare-two-unordered-lists-not-sets-in-python) for using `Counter()` to do it efficiently in `O(n)` time.

```python
def compare(s, t):
    # O(n) if elements are hashable
    return Counter(s) == Counter(t)
```

### Initialize `inf`
useful when try to init sth large to track the smallest value as python int has arbitrary precision (note: numpy & pandas are different since
they use C-style fixed-precision integers)
```python
diff = float('inf')
if new < diff:
    diff = new
```

### `bisect` Module (for binary search)
`bisect()`, `bisect_left()`, `bisect_right()` are useful to speed up binary search problem (one line code). `insort()` returns the list
after it's inserted. see more details in [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bisect-algorithm-functions-in-python/)

[code snippet to run](../snpts/bsct.py)
```python
def bs(nums: List[int], tar: int) -> int:
    # return the left most index to insert
    return bisect_lef(nums, tar)
```

### Unique List/String & Filtering Dups
Using `len()` and `set()`. Can also use the same trick to filter out duplicates in a list.
```python
# pythonic way (fastest)
a = "hello"
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
len(set(a)) == len(a) # return False
len(set(b)) == len(b) # return True

# filtering duplicates
l = [1, 1, 2]
l = list(set(l)) # return [1, 2]
```
